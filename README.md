# SentimentSense

The major aim of the SentimentSense project is to create a sentiment analysis system capable of detecting sarcasm in textual data, a challenge that conventional sentiment models encounter. Sarcasm inherently inverts or contradicts the literal meaning of words, frequently rendering it deceptive for fundamental sentiment analysis algorithms. This framework will combine Natural Language Processing (NLP) models with methods specifically designed for sarcasm detection, providing insights that are contextually relevant and sentiment-sensitive. SentimentSense aspires to be the premier solution for sarcasm analysis across many platforms, particularly in social media and customer feedback sectors.
